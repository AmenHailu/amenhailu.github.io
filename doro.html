                                    <p>Doro Wat is one of Ethiopia's most beloved dishesâ€”and my personal favorite. This richly spiced, slow-cooked chicken stew is full of deep, savory flavors and is known for its bold, red color, thanks to berbere, a blend of chili peppers, garlic, ginger, and various spices that adds just the right amount of heat. Made with bone-in chicken pieces, hard-boiled eggs, caramelized onions, and niter kibbeh (a spiced clarified butter), the stew develops a thick, luxurious sauce with a complex, spicy-sweet depth. Served with injera, Doro Wat is a dish meant to be savored and shared, often reserved for special gatherings and celebrations.</p>

                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Cut the chicken thighs into 1 inch pieces. Place the pieces in a bowl and pour lemon juice over. Let sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes.</li>
                                        <li>Mince the onions, garlic, and ginger.</li>
                                        <li>Heat the niter kibbeh (spiced butter) along with olive oil on a stove. Add the onions and saute, covered, over low heat for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
                                        <li>Add the garlic, ginger, and 1 tablespoon of butter and continue to saute, covered, for another 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
                                        <li>Hard boil the eggs in another pot. Peel the eggs and pierce them all over with a fork about 1/4 inch deep.</li>
                                        <li>Add the Ethiopian berbere (spice blend) and the 2 remaining tablespoons of butter and saute, covered, over low heat for another 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
                                        <li>Add the chicken, salt, and wine and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
                                        <li>Adjust the seasonings, adding more berbere according to heat preference. Add the boiled eggs and simmer on low heat, covered, for another 15 minutes.</li>
                                        <li>Half or quarter the eggs and arrange on the plates with the stew. Serve hot with injera, bread, or rice.</li>
                                    </ol>
