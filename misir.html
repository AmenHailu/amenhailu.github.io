                                    <p>Misir Wat is a stew made with red lentils, slowly simmered in a flavorful base of caramelized onions, garlic, and niter kibbeh (spiced clarified butter). This vegan-friendly dish owes its rich, deep red color and mildly spicy, complex flavor to berbere, a unique Ethiopian spice blend of chili, garlic, ginger, and a variety of warm spices. As the lentils cook, they absorb the buttery spices, creating a thick, creamy consistency that makes each bite deeply satisfying. Misir Wat is often served as part of a traditional Ethiopian meal, accompanied by injera (the spongy flatbread made from teff) to scoop up the stew. Itâ€™s a nutritious, protein-packed dish, beloved for its comforting warmth and versatility, often enjoyed on its own or alongside other wats (stews) and vegetable dishes in a traditional platter.</p>

                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Coarsely chop the onions and use a food processor to mince the chopped onions.</li>
                                        <li>In a medium saucepan, melt the niter kibbeh over medium heat.</li>
                                        <li>Add the onions, garlic and ginger, and cook for 15 minutes or until the mixture turns to a puree. Turn the heat to low once the mixture starts to boil and stir the mixture while it's cooking to prevent burning.</li>
                                        <li>Add the black pepper and all the other spices, cook for 1 minute; continue to stir the mixture to prevent burning.</li>
                                        <li>Wash the lentils with water in a sieve over the sink. Add the lentils, tomato paste, broth, and salt to the onion mixture in the pot. Mix the ingredients together. Turn the stove to medium heat, cover the pot and bring the stew to a boil.</li>
                                        <li>Once the stew starts to boil, turn the heat to low and let the stew simmer on low heat for 35 minutes or until the lentils are soft and the broth is reduced to your liking. Gently stir the stew occasionally as it cooks and add more broth if the stew gets too thick for your liking.</li>
                                        <li>Serve with injera or rice.</li>   
                                    </ol>
